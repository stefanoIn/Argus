                As cities grow, they create their own climate. Urban areas become islands of heat, 
                significantly warmer than the surrounding countryside. This is the story of how 
                satellite data reveals this hidden phenomenon and what it means for millions of people.

                        Picture a city from above, viewed through a thermal camera. What you'd see 
                        is striking: the urban core glows like a hot ember, while the surrounding 
                        countryside appears cool and dark. This is an Urban Heat Island—a metropolitan 
                        area that experiences significantly warmer temperatures than its rural surroundings.

                        The temperature difference is most dramatic at night, when urban areas can be 
                        1-3°C warmer on average, and up to 12°C warmer in extreme cases. This isn't 
                        just a curiosity—it affects energy consumption, public health, and the daily 
                        lives of millions of urban residents.

                        <p>
                            Trees and plants provide natural cooling through shade and evapotranspiration. 
                            Urban areas typically have 20-40% less vegetation than rural areas, losing 
                            this critical cooling mechanism.

                        <p>
                            Concrete, asphalt, and brick absorb and store heat during the day, releasing 
                            it slowly at night. These materials have low albedo (reflectivity), meaning 
                            they absorb more solar energy than natural surfaces.

                            Tall buildings create "urban canyons" that trap heat and reduce wind flow. 
                            Multiple surfaces absorb and re-radiate heat, creating a complex thermal 
                            environment that intensifies warming.

                        <p>
                            Human activities generate significant waste heat from vehicles, air conditioning, 
                            and industrial processes. This anthropogenic heat directly contributes to 
                            elevated urban temperatures.

                        These factors don't work in isolation—they create a feedback loop. As cities 
                        get hotter, people use more air conditioning, which generates more waste heat, 
                        making cities even hotter. Breaking this cycle requires understanding not just 
                        the causes, but the consequences.

                            Increasing vegetation through parks, green roofs, and street trees can reduce

                        <p>
                            Several limitations and constraints should be considered when interpreting the results. 
                            These limitations affect the accuracy, generalizability, and reliability of the findings:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Data Coverage Gaps:</strong> Satellite data may have spatial or temporal gaps 
                                due to cloud cover, sensor limitations, orbit patterns, or data processing failures. 
                                Missing data coverage may bias results if gaps are not randomly distributed. 
                                Approximately [fill this]% data coverage was achieved after cloud masking and quality filtering.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Spatial Resolution Limitations:</strong> The spatial resolution of satellite 
                                imagery ([fill this]) may limit the ability to detect 
                                fine-scale temperature variations within urban environments. Sub-pixel mixing may 
                                affect temperature measurements at boundaries between land cover types.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Temporal Bias:</strong> Data collection times may not represent all times of 
                                day or seasons equally. Most satellite thermal imagery is collected at specific times 
                                (Landsat at ~10:30 AM local time). This temporal bias may not capture peak heat 
                                island effects, which often occur in late afternoon or evening. Seasonal coverage spans 
                                [fill this] with varying completeness across seasons.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Measurement Uncertainty:</strong> Thermal sensors have inherent measurement 
                                errors ([fill this] for Landsat thermal bands). These errors propagate through the analysis 
                                pipeline. Atmospheric correction introduces additional uncertainty of approximately [fill this].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Land Use Classification Accuracy:</strong> Urban/rural classifications may not 
                                capture all relevant environmental factors (e.g., vegetation density, building height, 
                                material types). Classification was performed using [fill this] methods 
                                with approximately [fill this]% accuracy, which may introduce systematic biases.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Scale Dependency:</strong> Results may vary depending on the spatial and temporal 
                                scales of analysis. Aggregation to larger scales may mask local variations, while 
                                fine-scale analysis may be limited by data resolution.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Biases in Data Collection:</strong> Systematic biases may exist due to sensor 
                                calibration issues, atmospheric conditions, or processing algorithms. These biases may 
                                affect absolute temperature values more than relative comparisons.
